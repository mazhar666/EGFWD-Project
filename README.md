# EGFWD-Project
this was my first project in professional track in EGFWD scholarship.
I made it responsive and i was practicing the DOM Manipulation.
so i made the page dynamic when new section added to the HTML, it dynamically add a new list in the Nav bar based on its data-set value in the new section.
